Hi! Iâ€™m Xiaorui. I'm a senior at Berkeley studying computer science, data science, and history. Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher advised by [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com/) in [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/), researching user-centered design at the intersection of HCI and PL. My projects include an eDSL for creating HIL data transformation GUIs and an interface which supports designers in generating robust Arduino code. Looking forward, I am interested in learning more about technical HCI. I want to understand end users and build systems that address their programming and data needs. I hope to use my background in data science, GIS, and digital humanities to inform the domains I research. Adjacently, I want to draw on the humanities to understand how systems work can be informed by critical HCI. 

Before research and discovering computer science, my interests largely were within the humanities. While I love history generally, I specifically enjoy learning about the history of science, STS, and intellectual history. Outside of coursework, I have had the pleasure of being a teaching assistant across multiple courses at Berkeley. In my free time, I like cooking/baking, playing video games, and watching movies!
